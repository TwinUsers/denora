Denora v2.0 - git-alpha
-------------

Additions
01/02/2014 : ErrMsgStr() wrapper on strerror()/strerror_s() cuts back on the amount of code to get a error message.
01/02/2014 : MainTimer events : like cron but these events are done on the main() loop, this is handy for database
             backups, pinging. Things that should happen on a regular basis or after small amount of time has passed.
01/02/2014 : StatServ EXPORT now allows for file name of the exported data, as a safety Denora locks the output to the 
             data dir.
01/02/2014 : MariaDB support - basically MySQL at this point just renamed
12/19/2013 : Stats struct is now loaded and saved from sqlite
12/19/2013 : New internal lib functions that can be helpful to coders
					int SizeOfArray(char **array)  - returns number of entries in the array
					char *trimwhitespace(char *str) - Just like PHP's trim() function, strips leading and trailing white space
12/19/2013 : Exclude system rewritten to use sqlite backend, and find_exclude() no longer looks at if its a user
             or server, when adding an exclude you 

			 /statserv exclude add USER trystan
			 /statserv exclude add SERVER services.network.com

12/18/2013 : Spamfilter uses sqlite backend, reduced the number of sqlmod queries as well.
12/18/2013 : ircvsprintf() and ircvsnprintf() both now support %q as a format char, kinda of borrowed from sqlite
             what it does escapes your variable and adds it to the string and frees the escape variable, meaning
             you do not need to do this in your code any more, no more rdb_escape()

				char *myvar ='\'
				ircsnprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "SQL Escaped %q  Not %s", myvar, myvar);

				SQL Escaped \\  Not \

12/17/2013 : Admins set in the config file can now have their password encrypted by default
12/17/2013 : TLD moved to SQLite backend
12/17/2013 : XML Config system replaces block config system
12/17/2013 : Core builds with the flags to support Perl and Python modules
12/17/2013 : SQLite and GeoIP are now setup as libraries so we can move them out of the main source folder (TODO)
12/16/2013 : New command line switch -config=filename this allows you to setup and test configs easier
12/15/2013 : Backtrace lib of execinfo from BSD is built as part of the libs, this will give everyone backtrace()
12/14/2013 : SQL Backtrace is no longer set in the ./Config 
12/14/2013 : Autoconf tools for detecting Perl and Python are included just not used yet
12/14/2013 : As part of the making compiling look pretty we turned off all the MAKE echo's you can see them if you want
             by doing MAKE verbose
12/13/2013 : Code builds with CCDV a small util that makes the build process look better, borrowed from neostats 
			 and UltimateIRCD who got it from ncftp.
12/13/2013 : With the new xml configs user can define statserv's ident and host separately
12/13/2013 : Encryption has been made modular, right now we have MD5/Libcrypt and Plain Text
12/12/2013 : SQL has been moved to modular format, this removes all #ifdef USE_MYSQL from the code base, full
             documation of how to use sqlmods to come, right now its rough draft.
12/11/2013 : Added Ratbox v3 protocol, retired the Ratbox v2 protocol module
12/08/2013 : IRCd Protocol files use an xml config file to handle all of their configuration settings.
12/06/2013 : UnrealIRCd support for User Mode +I and CAPAB support of ESVID while we do not do anything
             or have data to work with ESVID just have it out there for later.
12/02/2013 : Added xmlparser - its a home brew way for us to parse our new xml config format
12/02/2013 : Added in the newst GeoIP c API library - this includes GeoCity as well as being able
             to get timezone and region name.
12/02/2013 : Added Sqlite 3.8.1 nightly build 11/27/2013 - while we could attempt to build against
             libs out there, its safe to bet not everyone has it, and we can slim it down and add
             in our own functions
12/02/2013 : Added sqlite3 shell, while its not hooked up at this point. From the command prompt
             of stats we will be able to call ./stats -sqlshell and be able to do debugs on the 
             database.

Changes
12/12/2013 : Module Data used sqlite backend, you must pass the module name, what has the value, the key and the value.
12/11/2013 : Restructored documentation, added html based documentation
12/06/2013 : IRCdVar struct changes
				1. statservmode changed to servicesmode
				2. Added szline_table, to be like the rest of the s*line parameters
12/02/2013 : Changed add_sqladmin
				1. From void to int - so we can trap for errors upstream
				2. New paramater of "configadmin" since this is how we add admins now, we need to be able to flag them here
12/02/2013 : Changed admins struct as follows
				1. Renamed "legal" struct member to level, unused in previous code
				2. Changed "hosts" struct member to be a char *, instead of an array, previous code
                   has never used more than 1 host
12/01/2013 : Removed "configure" script in favor of having config calling autoconf in config
             may add more auto* options in the future so we build denora with the best results
             for the given system

Fixes
01/02/2014 : Fixed SS_EXPORT "export servers" now matches "export all" in the server block 				[backported fix to 1.5.1]
