Denora v2.0 - git-alpha
-------------

Additions
12/06/2013 : UnrealIRCd support for User Mode +I and CAPAB support of ESVID while we do not do anything
             or have data to work with ESVID just have it out there for later.
12/06/2013 : Most of the IRCd are updated to use xml config files to handle a lot of the settings. 
			 the rest will be updated in a commit later.
12/02/2013 : Added xmlparser - its a home brew way for us to parse our new xml config format
12/02/2013 : Added in the newst GeoIP c API library - this includes GeoCity as well as being able
             to get timezone and region name.
12/02/2013 : Added Sqlite 3.8.1 nightly build 11/27/2013 - while we could attempt to build against
             libs out there, its safe to bet not everyone has it, and we can slim it down and add
             in our own functions
12/02/2013 : Added sqlite3 shell, while its not hooked up at this point. From the command prompt
             of stats we will be able to call ./stats -sqlshell and be able to do debugs on the 
             database.

Changes
12/06/2013 : IRCdVar struct changes
				1. statservmode changed to servicesmode
				2. Added szline_table, to be like the rest of the s*line parameters
12/02/2013 : Changed add_sqladmin
				1. From void to int - so we can trap for errors upstream
				2. New paramater of "configadmin" since this is how we add admins now, we need to be able to flag them here
12/02/2013 : Changed admins struct as follows
				1. Renamed "legal" struct member to level, unused in previous code
				2. Changed "hosts" struct member to be a char *, instead of an array, previous code
                   has never used more than 1 host
12/01/2013 : Removed "configure" script in favor of having config calling autoconf in config
             may add more auto* options in the future so we build denora with the best results
             for the given system
