Denora v2.0 - git-alpha
-------------

Additions
12/02/2013 : Added xmlparser - its a home brew way for us to parse our new xml config format
12/02/2013 : Added in the newst GeoIP c API library - this includes GeoCity as well as being able
             to get timezone and region name.
12/02/2013 : Added Sqlite 3.8.1 nightly build 11/27/2013 - while we could attempt to build against
             libs out there, its safe to bet not everyone has it, and we can slim it down and add
             in our own functions
12/02/2013 : Added sqlite3 shell, while its not hooked up at this point. From the command prompt
             of stats we will be able to call ./stats -sqlshell and be able to do debugs on the 
             database.


Changes
12/01/2013 : Removed "configure" script in favor of having config calling autoconf in config
             may add more auto* options in the future so we build denora with the best results
             for the given system

Fixes
11/29/2013 : Removed data from uid struct on user being disconnected.
