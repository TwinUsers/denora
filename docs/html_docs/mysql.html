Denora MySQL Support<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
1) Introduction<br />
<br />
    The MySQL support in Denora allows users to get real time statistics through
    SQL, for example via Web.<br />
    We suggest you take a look at phpDenora (http://www.denorastats.org/).<br />
<br />
2) Requirements<br />
<br />
    1. MySQL server version 4.x or greater **<br />
    2. MySQL libs and development files (usually called libmysql-dev or similar).<br />
    3. A MySQL user account<br />
    4. A MySQL database<br />
<br />
3) Installation<br />
<br />
    1. The ./Config script automatically detects if your system is capable
       of running Denora with MySQL support. There is no need anymore to
       answer yes when asked.<br />
<br />
       Note: You might need to run "(g)make distclean" prior to running ./Config<br />
<br />
    2. Compile Denora as usual. The (g)make process will now compile MySQL
       support into Denora.<br />
<br />
    3. Install Denora as usual. <br />
<br />
4) Configuration<br />
<br />
    1. Go to your "stats bin directory" (eg: /home/someuser/stats/) and run ./mydbgen 
       to help on the schema creation and adjustments.<br />
<br />
    2. Edit denora.conf and add your MySQL data to the MySQL configuration
       block. <br />
<br />
    3. Start or restart services to make use of the new Denora executable.<br />
<br />
<br />
** Note on older mysql such as 3.x are no longer fully supported it is recommended that
   you update to a more current version of mysql.<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: Windows builds of Denora with MySQL<br />
<br />
	There can be times when trying to builde Denora on Windows systems where you get a compiler error of<br />
<br />
		error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _mysql_<br />
<br />
	To resolve do the following, first start with a clean installation<br />
<br />
1. Download Connector/C from MySQL located at, select the non-installer version<br />
<br />
   http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/c/<br />
<br />
2. Unpack the zip file to C:\Program Files\MySQL\mysql_connect<br />
<br />
3. Run Config.bat as normal, allowing Denora to generate the Makefile.inc.win32<br />
<br />
4. Open Makefile.inc.win32 and change the following lines<br />
<br />
MYSQL_LIB="C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\lib"<br />
MYSQL_INC="C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\include"<br />
<br />
needs to read<br />
<br />
MYSQL_LIB="C:\Program Files\MySQL\mysql_connect\lib"<br />
MYSQL_INC="C:\Program Files\MySQL\mysql_connect\include"<br />
<br />
and
<br />
LIBS=$(LIBS) mysqlclient.lib zlib.lib<br />
<br />
to be
<br />
LIBS=$(LIBS) libmysql.lib zlib.lib<br />
<br />
5. Build as normal<br />
<br />
