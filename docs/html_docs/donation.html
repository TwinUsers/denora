Denora is an open source, free software. However the developers have put a lot
of time, money and effort into making the program what it is today.<br />
<br />
If you want to assist us or show your appreciation to the development team, use
the SourceForge linke below. You are not required to send anything and you can feel
free to ignore this. We're not asking for anything huge, whatever you can afford is fine.<br />
