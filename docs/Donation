Denora is a open source, freeware program. However the developers have put a lot
of time, money and effort into making the program what it is today. To many it
simpler for users to assist or show the appreciation the development team, uses
PayPal to accept donations. Users are not required to send anything and you can feel
free to ignore this. We're not asking for anything huge, whatever you can afford is fine.

PayPal Donation Link:
<https://www.paypal.com/xclick/business=trystanscott%40comcast.net&
 item_name=Denora+Donation&no_shipping=1&cn=Comments&tax=0&currency_code=USD>

Or simply send a payment through PayPal to:
trystanscott@comcast.net

If you don't want to use PayPal, or you want to donate something other than money
(old computer hardware, etc.), contact Trystan (trystan@nomadirc.net) before sending
anything

All donators will be listed on the website (regardless of the amount). To make 
this possible, please include along with your donation the name (or nickname) you want to 
appear in the list as well as the company name (or IRC server) to list. 

Thank you for your support,
The Denora Dev Team
