Denora v1.5.0
-------------

Additions
13/11/22 Exclude now supports wildcard matching.
13/11/15 From command line -v (alias of -version) and -? (alias of -help) been added
13/11/04 Full support for ircu and nefarious channel mode +A/U
13/11/04 ModuleCreateConfigDirective() cleaner way to pass to moduleGetConfigDirective()
13/10/23 Adds m4 directory, the configure files are getting nasty, time to move macros where
         they belong.
13/10/21 Added regex.h to the build, core and modules can now use this to pattern 
         match with regular expressions. 
13/01/13 Added support for ircu's channel mode +R (was missing)

Changes
13/11/22 Removed mypasql.c and mypasql.def neither have been used in a long time.
13/11/22 Removed dmalloc, when actually hooked up correctly denora crashed using it.
13/11/20 base64_decode() removed last parameter of length, was never used.
13/11/18 Not finding mysql_config no longer causes configure to exit on an error, just throw a warning
13/11/15 Denora no longer says "Service not started" if the config file is missing, it gives a

13/11/11 Moved do_umode() hack from 1.4.0 to the protocol like it should have been.
13/11/06 denora.sql no longer includes ison table data, all this is move to the ircd based
         sql files to remove extra columns that we will never set on that ircd.
13/11/03 ModData functions require you to call it with your modules name, since moddata structs
         were broken up until this point it shouldn't be a huge deal.
13/10/24 Removes some future features so 1.5 can roll
13/10/24 Removes Postgre from the code, was never used or really compiled for, maybe in the futre
13/10/22 Removed configure searches to embed perl in the code

         coding.
13/10/31 change_user_realname() escaped the user->realname field then called on rdb_escape() again
         in the query, thus leaking memory.

13/10/29 Rewrote dmalloc checks of the code, this should avoid the ./configure script saying its
         building with dmalloc when its not installed.
13/10/29 ./Config script clean up and bug fix, where some questions it did not use the cache setting
         for a defaulting answer, it would default back to script settings.

13/10/17 StatServ ADMIN SETPASS now updates SQL with the password

         use MOD_STOP if there is error binding the commands.
13/10/16 HTML modules no longer load if html is disabled, and return MOD_STOP if there is an error
