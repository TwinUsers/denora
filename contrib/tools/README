eggdrop stats.mod -> denora chanstats converter [smconv.pl]
-----------------------------------------------
version 1.0.0 - <Hal9000@pimpmylinux.org>

INTRODUCTION
This converter, written in Perl, is intended to use for importing the database file
(usually 'statsmod.dat') of the popular stats.mod module for eggdrop bots.
The converter is non-destructive, in other words it will NOT overwrite any existing
data in your denora installation. Instead, it will smartly merge the data by summing
the various values with the existing ones, if existing.
So this converter works well both on new installs as well as on denora databases
which have been in use for some time.

REQUIREMENTS
As of the current version, the converter has been tested on Denora 1.0.1 build 370
with UnrealIRCd 3.2 database schema, stats.mod 1.3.3 database and MySQL 4.1.
The converter "should" work on any database scheme, and should work on any
stats.mod 1.3.x and 1.4.x databases as well (maybe earlier dbs too), but has
not been tested.

BEFORE CONVERTING
- Place smconv.pl into the directory where denora is installed and chmod +x
  if necessary.
- Copy your stats.mod file into the denora directory as well.
- Please note that the converter will have to shut down denora during upgrade.
  MAKE SURE YOU DISABLE ANY CRON CHECKS TO KEEP DENORA FROM STARTING UP DURING CONVERSION!

CONVERTING
Run ./smconv.pl and follow instructions on screen.
If you chose option 1 or 2, you will be asked three questions, asking wether to
convert monthly/weekly/daily stats. Just answer 'y' to all those questions, unless
you stopped using stats.mod yesterday or earlier.
For example, if you stopped using stats.mod at the end of last month,
and now the first week of the new month just started, you won't need to import
daily/weekly/monthly stats as they would refer to last month. Be careful on this
or you'll get a database with wrong data.

Contact the author for any feedback. Thank you.
